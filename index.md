Yay, it's a blog!

How was Lambda Oinks Made?
------
Of course, being me, I decided to opt out of an easy, ready-made blogging platform, like [Medium] or [WordPress]. Instead, I went with what all the cool kids[^1] are using: [GitHub Pages] for hosting, and [Hakyll] for static site generation---'cuz, Haskell. ([More on how this blog was made later].)

[^1]: I was inspired by [Davidad], and he's cool, so there.

What is Lambda Oinks?
------

This is a blog for all things lambda and oinks. More concretely, I plan to post about technical stuff[^2] and personal thoughts. I'm using the pseudonym Oinkina[^3] so that I can write more freely[^4]. I'm ideologically in favor of having my thoughts be public, but I'm generally a private person, so using a pseudonym feels like a good compromise. This will also make it easier for me to be aggressively honest and open.

[^2]: "Lambda" as in Haskell, math, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">anonymous functions</a>, geddit? 
[^3]: My adopted older sister donned me oinkina because she loves baby pot-bellied pigs, and the nickname stuck.
[^4]: If you know who I am, please refrain from exposing my real identity.

Here are some of the general topics I intend to cover. I'm no expert in any of these, but I will write about my experiences.

* math, programming, and neural networks
* being female in a community with a highly skewed gender ratio
* thoughts on how to learn independently (I've been out of school since 10th grade)
* being an emancipated minor
* what it was like being religiously Jewish
* daily adventures I'm having, and how my life compares to my life a year ago

It will be interesting to see how this changes.

Why Blog?
-----

My life has undergone many big changes in the past few months. Sometimes I feel like my life is a story, and I string chapters around my fingers as time keeps passing by.

I love to write. Some days I dump out thousands of words just to get the thoughts out of my head[^5]. It seems somewhat wasteful to keep it all private. A lot of this content will come from private musings and brainstorms, so please give me the benefit of the doubt and assume good intentions.

[^5]: <a href="http://750words.com/">750 Words</a> is a wonderful website for this.

I imagine some of these stories might be at least amusing to others. Despite my [biased perspective], it seems that my life is significantly different from others that are demographically similar to me.

So, now I'm blogging.
